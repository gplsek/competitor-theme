			<strong>Notes: </strong>It may be the espresso cart capital of the world, but the lush, green city of Seattle is also extremely multicultural and is influenced by the Pacific Rim in art and architecture. If you're looking for a hotel in Seattle that's as close to downtown as it is to the airport, we think you'll appreciate the Hampton Inn&reg; Seattle-Southcenter. It's located in the south central area of King County with excellent freeway access and just a 10-minute drive from Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (with complimentary hotel shuttle service). The pro sports teams play right near our hotel in Seattle and within minutes you can be at the Museum of Flight, historic buildings and shops, Elliot Bay Waterfront and the famous Pike Place Market.
